            <p class="center">PNSync is a student friendly website created by Grade 12 12ESTEM-C6 students of the University of Cabuyao. 
                Learning materials of different types can be found within the site to help engage students with their academics. Modules, PPTs
                and other materials from different instructors can be found within PNSync to aid students' studies with the goal of giving the 
                different views and insights for certain topics to further enhance their understanding of lessons. Having a limited source for learning 
                materials is a problem that is usually faced by public schools, or schools with limited budget. This happens due to the current pricing 
                of books that prove difficulty for some education institutions to acquire. PNSync covers those types of problems by providing students with
                a variety of learning materials that they will be able to access. PNSync would serve as the host or library for learning materials that can 
                be used for several academic school years. PNSync can be launched for different schools with it's only requrement being wifi or mobile 
                data connection and any device capable of wifi connectivity. Along with some of the local government's technology related plans, PNSync can become a great addition.
